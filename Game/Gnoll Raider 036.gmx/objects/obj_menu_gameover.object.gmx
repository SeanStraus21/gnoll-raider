/*

Oh I recently got in a fight/
During which I attempted to bite/
off the arm of a guy/
who was swingin' a sai/
and I lost all the limbs on my right
Now my torso's unpleasantly light


Everybody around me is dead/ 
but that's not what I princip'ly dread/ 
For I'm highly attuned/ 
to this big gaping wound/ 
and I seem to be losing my head/ 
and I'm holding to life by a thread


I never could think what it was
That a corpse ordinarily does
way down in the ground
in its burial mound
But I think I...

Let tell a short story to you
A tale of a guy who is blue
I was scouting ahead
when to my greatest dread
I 

To all of the people back home,
Wherever you wander or roam
if a journey you take/ 
please observe my mistake/ 
And do not take an axe to the dome

I used to believe that a fool...

I believe that I have been a fool
For I always thought that I should rule
but when I'd declare
that that I was an heir
I discovered that fate can be cruel

Yes I think that the time has now come
For me to drink gallons of rum
If my liver should fry,
tis no matter to I,
for 

I'm imbibing some old karajiz
Though it maketh my poor liver fizz
Its no matter to me
For as you can see
I am practically dead as it is

I once had a parrot named bob
just to think of him now makes me sob
for he died of some stones
that had cracked all his bones
and now I'm 

I once watched a man kill a fly
with a big piece of blueberry pie
and in much the same way
I am sorry to say
I am shortly hereafter to die

As I wait for my death knell to toll/ 
there's a virtue I'd like to extoll/ 
I'm convinced that its best/ 
To let sleeping dogs rest/ 
When they're roughly the size of a troll.# - Gnoll Death Poem";
