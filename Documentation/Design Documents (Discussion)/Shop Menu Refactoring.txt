NEW SHOP MENU

The idea of the list is a good one. Use the system from the Skill Menu though. don't create an individual item, let each item hold the id of an item in the inventory.
for efficient drawing, simply set the item type, stock_count, etc. on the button

RE4:
	This menu is divided into four unequal parts:
	1. Item List (the list form seems much maligned, so we may consider something that will make better use of the screen)
		a scrolling list in which each bar shows the following: (Name; stock; price)
		In RE4 there are no tabs or filters, probably because the types of goods are 75% weaponry and 20% useable
	2. Item Preview:
		displays a larger image of the object hovered over
		if the item is a weapon, this box also shows the weapon's stats
	3. Item Description
		shows detailed information about the item itself
	4. decorative blank space
		kind of pointless, but pretty small anyway.
	Controls are simple up and down, through the scroll list.
	There is no explicit buy, switch, or back button in the UI. 
		Instead, 'A' brings up a "do you want to buy?" dialogue with just a yes and no.
		'B' returns to the main shop menu
	Shop Main holds four options in a simplistic, non-wrapping, radial menu.
		Buy
		Sell
		Upgrade
		Cancel
Bear in mind RE4 was a console game

Rogue Legacy:
	This menu works in three stages. the A(forward) and B(back) buttons are used to navigate the stages, while directional keys navigate within the current selection
	first stage: talk to merchant
	second stage: select tab
	third stage: purchase/equip
	
Bear in mind there was no Selling or inventory system in rogue legacy. there were only a fixed quantity of items to be bought
