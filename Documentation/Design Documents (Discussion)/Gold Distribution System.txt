Gold Distribution System

Between 25$ and 50% of total Gold is stored in treasure chests

G = total gold amount for the dungeon
T = treasure (between G/4 and G/2)
C = loose money (G - T)
n = room_count

Coin Distribution
Coins should be distributed as a bell curve
example distribution:

for n = 10:
average = 100%/n = 10%
increment = 10%/(n/2)

room1:	2%
room2:	4%
room3:	6%
room4:	8%
room5:	10%

room6:	10%
room7:	12%
room8:	14%
room9:	16%
room10:	18%

//if n is even
for(i=0;i<n/2;i+=1){
	l_add(average - i*increment);
	l_add(average + i*increment);
}

//if n is odd
n = 3
room1:	16.5%
room2:	33%
room3:	49.5%
+1% randomly distributed

for(i=1;i<(n+1)/2;i+=1){
	l_add(average - i*increment);
	l_add(average + i*increment);
}
l_add(average)

Treasure:

1. divide treasure amount into small chests.
2. determine how many of each higher denomination chests appear
small chest = 1 chest		55% of total chests
medium chest = 2 chests	34% of total chests
large chest = 3 chests	10% of total chests
super chest = 4 chests	1% of total chests

45% chance to be a small chest
35% chance to be included in a medium chest or smaller
15% chance to be included in a large chest or smaller
5% chance to be included in a super chest or lower



given 10 chests:

probably 4.5 are small
probably 3.5 are medium
probably 1.5 are large
probably .5 are super large

0.5 div 4 = 0 super
0.5 mod 4 = 0.5
0.5 + 1.5 = 2
2 div 3 = 0 large
2 mod 3 = 2
2 + 3.5 = 5.5
5.5 div 2 = 2 medium
5.5 mod 2 = 1.5
1.5 + 4.5 = 6 small

this seems like a good ratio.
