How to save and load tiles:

	tiles must be generated at runtime
	there is no cost involved in copying from a text file.
	however, there is a cost in calling actions while generating the chamber

	the advantage of attaching tiles to objects is that the depth can be calculated at run-time
	
	the advantage of not attaching tiles to objects is that 
	
STEP EVENT FOR LOAD_CONTROL
	if(i < chunks){
		run_script(load_chunk[i]);
	}
	
How to generate the scripts:

	compile a list of dummy objects. 
	the bulk of these should be terrain objects and tile objects
	after terrain and tile objects come doodads, enemies, interactive objects and randomizable tiles.
	we reserve the final chunk for system requirements that cannot be interfered with. 
	
	after we have our lists of dummy objects, determine how many objects should be written to each chunk. it seems that a hundred or so per step is reasonable.
	add two for the final system chunk and the header chunk to get the total chunk_count.
	
	write a series of text documents in the format export_i.txt
	in each document, write down the proper code to generate the designated number of objects
