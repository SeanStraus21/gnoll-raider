when is the path updated?

A)when a new goal is set (when the ends are invalidated)
	Assuming the enemy is in combat while running this routine, there are three circumstances that change this.
		1. The target_of_pursuit is no longer considered valid
			has been out of sight for too long
			is dead
			deemed too hazardous to pursue (caltrops, poison gas etc.)
		2. A more attractive target presents itself
			
B)when the path no longer leads to the goal (when the means are invalidated)
	2. the short term goal has been reached
	1. The target_of_pursuit is far from the path.
	

Idea for what to do if pathfinding is too inefficient

	in the level editor, in the compilation scripts:
	find areas that can be navigated without paths (i.e., by going straight towards a target.)
	for each terrain_tile, expand as far as possible in all directions 
	stop when the region cannot get larger in any direction without any tile being non-pathable from any other. 
	then assign each tile a unique region_id
	create objects that store each of the tiles in the region. these will be helpful for debugging and exporting;
	once all regions have been found, iterate through each tile in each region. save 
	
	only execute pathfinding routines
