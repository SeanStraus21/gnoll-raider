Detecting enemies by sight vs. detecting enemies by sound

In real life:
	scent works in a fixed radius and can't be avoided, tends to be shorter range than hearing (particles travel slower than sound waves)
	hearing works in a radius that gets smaller as the target gets sneakier
	sight works in a cone and is affected heavily by environmental variables

How this works in the game:
	Some enemies have the scent ability. These automatically detect the players no matter how sneaky they are
		scent has limited range. it is conceivable that some environmental circumstances could negate or weaken scent (wind, nearby garbage etc.)
	Other enemies have two senses: sight and hearing
	you can avoid being heard by being sneaky, but the closer you are, the better your chance of being heard. 
		enemies who are alert or otherwise have better awareness are harder to sneak up on.
		most enemies will not enter combat without visual confirmation, so will only BECOME_SUSPICIOUS
		the enemies hearing can be used against them to a certain extent, i.e., by creating a noise to distract a guard. this 
	sight can be foiled by using the terrain and by avoiding LOS
		standing at a higher elevation or behind an obstacle will break LOS
		approaching an enemy from behind will also foil LOS
		enemies without darkvision can only see things that are illuminated, ie, in range of a torch or fire.
		Additionally, a character seen out of the corner of the eye (at an angle) or in dim light by a non-suspicious guard will only make the guard BECOME_SUSPICIOUS, just like hearing. 


Pseudocode

	if(scent_smelled()){
		get_suspicious();
		detection_type = "scent";
	}else if(sound_heard()){
		get_suspicious();
		detection_type = "hearing";
	}else if(glimpse_caught()){
		get_suspicious();
		detection_type = "peripheral_vision";
	}
}

bool scent_smelled(){
	return object_in_range(obj,scent_radius);
}

bool sound_heard(){
	get detection_radius from stealth-awareness formula
	return object_in_range(obj,detection_radius);
}

bool glimpse_caught(){
	output = false;
	if(degree_diff(point_dir(),dir_face) <= 180){//if in range of peripherals
		if(object_in_range(obj,peripherals)){
			if(LOS){
				if(illuminated(obj)){
					output = true;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return output;
