Day 1 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/10/2016
 - set up AI test prototype
 - did main command stack frame

Day 2 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/11/2016
 - wrote some simple behaviours and got them to work with the command stack
 - wrote a bunch of subroutines for convenience

Day 3 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/12/2016
 - experimented with some pathing systems
 - expanded the command stack to have some enemy detection place-holders

Day 4 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/13/2016
 - investigated differing pathfinding routines
 - attempted recursive path_finding

Day 5 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/14/2016
 - attempted custom A* algorithm
 - examined bezier curve algorithm
 - examined theta*
 - debugged custom A* algorithm

Day 6 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/15/2016
 - continued work on custom A*
 - beat head against wall
 - for eight hours (2:00-10:00)
 - kept on debugging
 - hated game maker

Day 7 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/16/2016
 - completed custom A*
 - generalized collision checking for objects larger than a single tile
 - made some utility functions
 - wrote and debugged line of sight algorithm
 - expanded AI capabilities(engage, detect enemy, attack_begin, attack_execute, retreat)
 - graphics

Day 8 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/17/2016
 - began theta* algorithm
 - implemented detection routine
 - implemented combat routines

Day 9 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/18/2016
 - completed theta* algorithm
 - began work on path smoothing
 - worked on bugs with AI movement

For the Next Daily Scrum I will:
 - 1. work on enemy AI
	 - advanced features
		 - pursue
		 - manage targets
		 - strafe
	 - set up aggro system
	 - improve path reuse
		 - determine if path is still valuable
	 - animation programming
 - 2. paint stuff for loading and gameover screens
 - 3. fix graphical issues
	 - fix that tile-depth issue like we talked about (see Improved Tile Depth Solution)
	 - change that awful yellow tileset
