Day 1 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/10/2016
 - set up AI test prototype
 - did main command stack frame

Day 2 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/11/2016
 - wrote some simple behaviours and got them to work with the command stack
 - wrote a bunch of subroutines for convenience

Day 3 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/12/2016
 - experimented with some pathing systems
 - expanded the command stack to have some enemy detection place-holders

Day 4 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/13/2016
 - investigated differing pathfinding routines
 - attempted recursive path_finding

Day 5 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/14/2016
 - attempted custom A* algorithm
 - examined bezier curve algorithm
 - examined theta*
 - debugged custom A* algorithm

Day 6 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/15/2016
 - continued work on custom A*
 - beat head against wall
 - for eight hours (2:00-10:00)
 - kept on debugging
 - hated game maker

Day 7 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/16/2016
 - completed custom A*
 - generalized collision checking for objects larger than a single tile
 - made some utility functions
 - wrote and debugged line of sight algorithm
 - expanded AI capabilities(engage, detect enemy, attack_begin, attack_execute, retreat)
 - graphics

Day 8 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/17/2016
 - began theta* algorithm
 - implemented detection routine
 - implemented combat routines

Day 9 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/18/2016

Day 10 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/19/2016
 - nothing
Impediments: stuck in traffic for 3+ hours on account of icy roads

Day 11 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/20/2016
 - discovered AI bugs due to serious flaws in every part of the pathfinding system
 - attempted to optimize pathfinding
 - developed region-partitioning algorithm for block A*

Day 12 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/21/2016
 - fixed linear collision detection routine
 - Actually completed theta* (for real this time)
 - started debugging the rest of the mess

Day 13 Scrum Meeting:
Date: 01/22/2016

 - started working on some animations for the enemy

Day 14 Scrum Meeting
Date: 01/23/2016
 - kept worked on local pathfinding
 - developed an efficient formula for determining a curved path
