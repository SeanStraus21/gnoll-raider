Scrum 14 Goal is:
	SCRUM IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE. DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE GAME PLAYABLE NOW, EVEN IF THAT MEANS TURNING OFF FEATURES THAT AREN'T READY FOR PRODUCTION. TRY TO HIDE BAD GRAPHICS, USE SIMPLE SCALING ON SPRITES THAT ARE TOO SMALL
	Emergency Measures
		emergency-fix character creation by forcing defaults where menus are in-progress and ignoring choices that haven't been fully implemented
		Hide Non-implemented Options
		Add "Coming Soon" Sprites
	investigate the following multiplayer glitches to make sure they are fixed:
		game crash on enemy death
		host fails to move to the next room via Portal
		host automatically enters a chamber, even though the other players are not ready
	begin working on a stand animation for the rogue (24-32 subimages)
	Continue to revise customization system
		Update all panels to accommodate new system
		Alter Stuff to accommodate new class system
		Design Class and Attribute Menus
		Come up with better Graphics
	redesign the UI to be more user friendly and take advantage of upscaling.
