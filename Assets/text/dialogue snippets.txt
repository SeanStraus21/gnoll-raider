"The Zakasi are a species of bipedal hyenas, known for their "

"...The zakasi species is not native to Kaiya. During the Aruun Wars, many clans accompanied their Warahg Overlords. In the chaos following the final battle of Iabanu, these clans turned upon their former masters, and then scattered into the desert. Since that time, these kaiyan zakasi have become acclimated to their new home and are now found spread throughout the northlands."

"The two largest groups of kaiyan zakasi are the red zakasi and the grey zakasi. differing in ancestry and territory, the two are visibly distinct.

"The Skarzaki Clan is particularly shunned, as people tend to mysteriously vanish wherever they go, and the frequent accusations of demon-worship have never been satisfactorily refuted. Despite the fear and loathing they have come to inspire, their contacts in the criminal underworld and unique services have allowed them to thrive. According to the skarzaki themselves, their clan first received knowledge of the arts of murder and sabotage in exchange for blood oaths and promises of human sacrifice to a Raktarath Lord."

"Sarithas Ashras Sithrai commands immense respect and fear by virtue of his status as second-in-command to Yashjiras Sarai. House Sithrai has only recently come under the vassalage of the most ancient House of Sarai, but already they have proven themselves to be among its finest agents. In addition to his exalted rank as a Sarithas of House Sarai, Ashras is also a master of the dark arts, and a strong candidate for appointment to the Necrarch Council upon the ultimate failure of his physical form."
