Ragsheer's Demise Dialog


"Please, lord Sithrai, I beg you, I..."
"Be silent. I have no time to waste on habitual failures, and you exhausted my patience long ago. However, it is my understanding that your people retain the old custom of succession by ritual combat. Since your official rank is of use to me, I will give you the opportunity to contest your title and my favor against your successor."

"Thank you my lord, your mercy is..."

*glare* "You, skarzaki. I grant you leave to challenge your superior for his title, and his position as my chief agent within the khurikash."

"Thank you my lord. I will accept your offer"
"I don't have anything against you personally, Ragsheer. you've been a decent commander. But if you won't step down, don't hope for mercy."

"As if his lordship would let me leave this alive. If I'm going to die, I'll do it with some dignity. I'm certainly not stepping aside for a runt like you."

"But of course."

*fight* *keekarak wins*

"It seems my judgement has not failed me. I hope that my judgement is equally accurate with regard to your skill as a commander." 

"As I live, I will not fail you, my lord"

"Indeed. But the formalities of succession must wait. Your predecessor has made a serious blunder and risked exposure of my operation here. Take your best warriors and remove the evidence of our activities. Should you succeed"
