How to handle Stealth

Specs
1. Some Enemies are better at detecting enemies than others
2. Some Characters are sneakier than others
3. Its possible that some enemies can see the character while others can't
4. Its probable that if one enemy detects the character, others will too.
5. Effectiveness of stealth depends on distance
6. Any Randomness involved should take place in determining the Base Awareness of the spotter
7. Potential Awareness Level and Sneakiness are theoretically limitless

Detection Routine
Step 1: establish vision radius of spotter
Step 2: establish if LOS to target exists
if target is in range and spotter has LOS, perform the following checks
	Step 3: Find Spotter's Base Awareness Value
	Step 4: Find target's Base Sneakiness Value
	Step 5: Multiply Base Awareness Value by a factor determined by distance and target's sneakiness

Step 5 is the kicker
Our goal is to use the three values (Distance, Awareness, and Sneakiness) to find a boolean value;
0 distance should = 100% chance of spot
0% means outside of possible detection
the higher the likelihood of detection, the harder it is for the skulker to hide
since there is no theoretical cap to sneakiness or awareness, we should aim to determine minimum detection distance

Simple Solution: 
threshold = (awareness/ sneakiness)*sight_radius

This implies that the threshold increases as awareness and sight_radius increase, but decreases with sneakiness

Test Cases
(10/5)*500 = 1000
if awareness > sneakiness, the result is greater than sight range?
Implication: if spotter has higher awareness than sneaker has sneakiness, stealth automatically fails
stealth succeeds only by degree if greater, but spot wins completely if greater than stealth

Less Simple Solution
max threshold = sight_range
min threshold = 0

case 											:: Threshold(
(sneakiness == 0)					:: sight_range*1.0
(sneakiness > awareness > 0) :: sight_range*0.5
(sneakiness == awareness) :: sight_range*0.5
(sneakiness < awareness) :: sight_range*0.5
(awareness == 0)					:: sight_range*0.0

For a given sneakiness > 0, awareness > 0
no matter how high sneakiness is relative to awareness, mod never equals 0
no matter how high awareness is relative to sneakiness, mod never equals 1

Well, I worked at it for a long time. 
I found out a formula for the distribution I want, but it requires two separate formulae
one for when sneakiness <= awareness, and one when otherwise (both work for sneakiness == awareness)
I tried for a really, really long time to find a single function that would do the trick, but no luck
yeah, I kept trying, but its just going to take more math than I have in me. 

Anyway, 
if S >= A
	A/2S
Else
	1-(S/2A)
	
well, isn't it true that 2G = (A+S+abs(A-S))
the numerator is either (2G-S) if A is greater or (A) if S is greater
numerator is hard to account for though
2G - S: subtract S twice the larger
is A = 2G - S?
A = A + S - S + abs(A-S)
0 = abs(A-S)
So in conclusion, we can prove that A is never = to 2G - S unless A = S
which means there is definitely not going to be anything

The underlying idea is that the greatest of the two is the denominator, and the numerator is a number from 0 to 2*greatest
the numerator is given by S, if S is greater, or 2A - S if A is greater
