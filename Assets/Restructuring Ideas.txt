Restructuring Ideas

Player Object[]
player[pnum].hp vs. mu_hp[crnt_pnum]
player[pnum].abl_ready

Players wander off
	store room/chamber id
	we assume floor id is the same for now
	
Abstract out controls? 
	have obj_player remotely control the obj_gnoll
	Advantages: 
			persistent player object survives death and room transitions
			allow abstraction of formerly global variables
			allow abstraction of global cooldowns
	Disadvantages:
			Code Bloat (main_unit.x instead of just x, gets worse for things like move_contact_solid())
			Too many with statements
	
Need Better Collision System
	probably try to make an extension in C++ to avoid lag
Need Better Pathfinding System
